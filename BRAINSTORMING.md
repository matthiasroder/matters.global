# Frontend Brainstorming for Graph-Based Problem Management

This document outlines potential user interfaces, frontend applications, and multi-user considerations for the graph database implementation of matters.global.

## Web Interfaces

- Visual connection builder for linking to existing problems/conditions
- Real-time validation and formatting assistance

### Collaborative Workspace
- Team-oriented UI with user roles and permissions
- Real-time collaboration features (commenting, shared editing)
- Activity feeds showing recent changes to the problem network
- Version history and change tracking for problem definitions

### Knowledge Dashboard
- Summary views of problem clusters and domains
- Progress metrics and visualization of solution development

- Custom filtering and reporting tools

## Mobile Applications

### Problem Scanner
- Camera-based capture of potential problems from physical documents

### Document Processing Pipeline
- Batch processing of academic papers, reports, and documents
- Automatic extraction of problem statements and conditions
- Citation linking to source materials
- Integration with reference management systems

## Data Visualization

### Problem Network Explorer
- Force-directed graph visualization of the entire problem space
- Dynamic filtering by domain, status, or connection type
- Custom views with saved configurations
- Export capabilities for presentations and publications

### Solution Path Navigator
- Visual representation of paths from problems to potential solutions
- Critical path analysis for complex problem dependencies
- Alternative solution comparison views
- Progress tracking visualization

### Comparative View
- Side-by-side analysis of problem structures
- Difference highlighting between similar problems
- Historical comparison showing problem evolution
- Domain-specific comparison templates

## Specialized Tools

### Research Citation Connector
- Link problems to academic literature and research papers
- Citation graph integration with problem network
- Automatic suggestion of relevant research for specific problems
- Bibliography generation for problem domains

### Decision Support System
- Algorithmic recommendations for high-impact focus areas
- Resource allocation suggestions based on problem dependencies
- Risk assessment visualization for problem solving approaches
- Priority scoring based on multiple factors (impact, feasibility, urgency)

### Progress Tracker
- Visual dashboard for condition completion toward problem solutions
- Milestone tracking and celebration of problem-solving achievements
- Time-based visualization of progress
- Predictive analytics for solution timelines

## Additional Considerations

### Accessibility Features
- Screen reader compatibility for graph visualizations
- Keyboard navigation alternatives for graph exploration
- High-contrast viewing modes
- Text-based alternatives to visual representations

### Internationalization
- Multi-language support for problem descriptions
- Cultural consideration in problem representation
- Translation services for cross-language problem matching
- Region-specific problem templates

## Multi-User System Architecture

### Graph Schema Extensions

#### Additional Node Types
- `User`: {id, username, email, profile_info, preferences}
- `Organization`: {id, name, description}
- `Domain`: {id, name, description} (for categorizing problems)

#### Additional Relationships
- `(User)-[:CREATED]->(Problem/Condition/Solution)`: Attribution
- `(User)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(Organization)`: Organizational membership
- `(Problem)-[:CATEGORIZED_AS]->(Domain)`: Problem categorization
- `(User)-[:HAS_ACCESS]->{read|write|admin}->(Problem)`: Fine-grained permissions
- `(Organization)-[:OWNS]->(Problem)`: Organizational ownership
- `(User)-[:FOLLOWS]->(Problem)`: Interest/notification subscription

### Multi-User Considerations

#### Ownership & Attribution
- Problems can have creators (individual users)
- Organizations can own sets of problems
- Historical attribution preserved via timestamps on all created/modified nodes
- Version history for tracking problem evolution

#### Visibility & Access Control
- Public vs. private problems
- Organization-wide visibility
- Custom sharing with specific users/groups
- Varying permission levels (view, edit, admin)
- Inheritance of permissions through problem hierarchies

#### Collaboration Features
- Tracking who modified which nodes and when
- Comment/discussion threads attached to problems
- Change history and version control
- Notification system for changes to followed problems
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits

#### User Experience Design
- Personal dashboard with followed/created problems
- Organization views for team-level problem management
- Activity feeds for collaborative work
- Custom views based on user preferences
- Saved searches and filters for frequently accessed problem sets

#### Security Considerations
- Authentication system (OAuth, SSO options)
- Encryption for sensitive problem data
- Audit logs for compliance and security
- Role-based access control
- Data isolation between organizations

#### Scalability Planning
- Sharding strategies for large problem networks
- Caching of frequently accessed problem structures
- Read/write optimization for concurrent users
- Background processing for computationally intensive operations
